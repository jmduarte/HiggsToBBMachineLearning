## Introduction

This domain centers around applying modern machine learning techniques to
particle physics data.

## Result Replication

The bulk of the first half of the project will focus on the task of
identying Higgs boson decaying to bottom quarks. Specifically, reproducing 
(or surpassing) results in this paper (not necessarily with the same ML technique):
* [Interaction networks for the identification of boosted \\(H \to b\bar{b}\\)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12285)

This implies reproducing Figure 4, Figure 5, and if time permits Figure 8 in this paper.

The latter-half of Quarter 1 will introduce you to further topics to inform possible
avenues for further research.

## Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
[schedule](#schedule). Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of these tasks.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions to Canvas. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. If you have questions about your work, please ask
them in section or office hours.

You are responsible for the entire weekly reading/task, even if
portions are not covered in the weekly questions. The weekly tasks are
the building blocks for the project proposals/assignments due at the
end of the quarter.
